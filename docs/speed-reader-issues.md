### Speed reader issues

When loading a book into the speed reader on an actual phone, the loading animation played for a moment then froze completely - I thought the app crashed for a brief moment - then the speed reader loaded (no loading issues that I can tell). The loading animation should continue to play smoothly and uninterrupted until loading is complete. I also noticed that it takes much longer for the speed reader to load than normal books. Can you investigate the entire process of loading books into the speed reader? Perhaps things don't work this way behind the scenes, but in my head it feels like this is a simpler loading process than the normal reader (the speed reader only uses a word list and index, while the normal reader also processes text but also has more visual elements, perhaps that's not quite how it actually works though). Is there a way to smooth this out? Perhaps some kind of lazy loading approach to the actual reader? Though we still need to full index the book contents and get the total word count upfront for proper word counting, indexing, and similar for progress saving, restoring, and tracking purposes. Perhaps fully index/count upfront and then lazy loads the text? I'm not sure. Before implementing any kind of lazy loading, let's just examine the current process in full and see if there are any issues with it. The original speed reader was based off of the normal reader but has since been separated into an entirely separate reader. Perhaps the speed reader is still trying to load things using methods or in order that is still better suited to the normal reader instead of the speed reader (although, we did completely redesign much of the speed reading indexing and importing process as the speed reader basically just needed a list of text.)

Playback controls are not hiding with Auto-hide, but they should be auto-hiding with all of the other UI items when auto hide OSD is enabled.

We need to add a setting to make sure the screen doesn't turn off when in the speed reader (users aren't interacting with the screen during this time). The normal reader has a setting like controlled under Setting > Reader. We need to add a similar setting to the Speed Reader settings (added to both the settings menu after opening the speed reader and under the primary settings menu) to keep the screen on - this should be a toggle and is enabled by default, and make sure it is actually implemented to work properly

After installing on a real android phone, there is an immediate "Refresh" occurring when first installing the app (which opens to the library automatically). This refresh shows the same animation as if a user had swiped down on the library to refresh manually. In a previous version of my app, we were having issues with books showing up in the library after adding from local folders, and we added a workaround to auto-refresh the library every time it was visited. That "auto-refresh library workaround" should have already been removed. Please investigate and make sure both: the library does not refresh when the user opens the app for the first time (there are no books, so this does not make sense), and we no longer have the workaround to refresh the library every time it is opened. There is still a method in the app to refresh the library when books are added, we definitely need to keep this to make sure that books show up in the library after being added from local folders, but this shouldn't be the same as triggering the "manual refresh" option that would happen if users swiped down,

We recently added custom pre-processing or pre-loading to books for the speed reader. I have discovered that commas, apostrophes, quotes, em-dashes,. (maybe regular dashes) are not being displayed in the speed reader. These provide important context and structure for reading, so we need to fix this. The speed reader currently pauses on certain characters - this should remain the same. This is also causing some words or combinations of words to display incorrectly. The following is an example of one issue caused by the current implementation: the original text of a book used em dashes without spaces "because—still smiling—they" which caused the reader to show two words "Becausestill" then "smilingthey" 

We need to add a little more padding below the bottom row of items in speed reader to allow room for the Android nav bar. My speed reader is fullscreen, so it overlaps with the android status bar - we need to keep this fullscreen behavior, but simply move the bottom items up a little bit. We can perhaps calculate the height of the standard android nav bar (might be different depending on the device) and add padding to account for it.

I want to add a basic progress % to the bottom of the speed reader. Put this in line with the progress bar at the bottom of the reader (NOT at the bottom of the progress bar in the word picker). 

Custom fonts don't apply to speed reader. I can enable the toggle and select chips, but these fonts are not actually applying to the text in the speed reader.

#### Speed reader progress issues - important

The speed reader is not properly tracking, saving, or restoring progress (I'm not entirely which part of the process, or if multiple parts, are having issues). These are all things I have noticed, some may likely be related, but please fully investigate

- The speed reader should have a word count or index of all words in a book - this should be created when the book is first loaded into the speed reader. All progress from the speed reader should be based off of this word count such as {current word} / {total number of words}. The word that is in the reader (the one being displayed) when the user closes the app (including force closes) or goes back to the library should be the exact word that they return to. There should be functionality for things like saving the current word index when pausing or navigating forward/back (with navigation controls or tap zones, etc), then when the user re-opens the speed reader, it should load to this index and thus, display the word where the user left off. I think most of this is working by looking at the speed reader debug logs that we added, but I think the word picker might be interfering (though I am not 100% sure on that, so please check the full progress tracking/saving/resuming process). Instead, the speed reader seems to be resuming to the last word that was selected by the word picker. E.g. if I pick the 1,000th word with the word picker, then click "confirm" to send that word to the reader, then read 1000 more words, I stop on word 2000. If I quit the reader then come back, the speed reader restores progress to the 1,000th word.
- I am having a few issues with the word picker itself. Intended behavior is this: when I open the word picker with the button in the speed reader, it should scroll to and highlight the current word that is in the speed reader - this should only occur once when the word picker is first opened. This word should have a border color to differentiate it from the other words in the text. New words should not be highlighted unless the user manually taps/selects them. When I select a new word to start reading from a new place, the original word (the one currently in the reader before switching) gets a lighter background, and the new word that was tapped gets a border - this should show "where we were" vs "where we're going to start" reading from. The issue I am having: in addition to the progress issues above where the word selected in the word picker seems to be overriding or overwriting progress saving, when I scroll through the word picker, it is automatically highlighting the first word of each sentence as I scroll. E.g. if I scroll to where sentence 2 is at the top of the word picker, it automatically highlights the first word of sentence 2, if I scroll down to sentence 10, it highlights all of the first words of the sentences as I scroll: 3, 4, 5,... - 10. I think this is just a mistake in the logic of telling the word picker to highlight the current word from the reader - I think it is also highlighting the current word at the top of the word picker sentence list or similar.
- The Speed reader progress very off. When approximately 1.5% - 2% of the way through a book, the speed reader showed 77%. After reading further, this % grew to 200-300% (and I'm nowhere close to the end of the book).
- When I open the word picker panel, the slide in animation is rather laggy even on very fast phones (I have a near-flagship OnePlus 13 with a very fast hardware)., A simply panel slide animation should be smooth and fluid. There is also a bit of a delay when opening the Settings panel. Please investigate performance with these issues (and all panels on the speed reader). These panels should all have smooth, quick animations that start instantly when the user hits the corresponding button to open them.
- Horizontal bar length from the focus section should be a % of screen width. These bars are far too short on tablets or larger android screens. These bars should stretch 90-95% of the width of the screen with a little space on either side.
- Also, the lines and arrows under the focus section should scale with font size, so when font size increases and words take up more space, the lines and arrows scale outward properly (currently, increasing font sizes makes the focus section more "cramped" as lines and arrows are staying the same width)
- Currently "Lines" is the default focus indicator setting, I would like to make this "off" by default instead.
