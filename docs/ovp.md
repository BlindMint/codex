For the hybrid Optimal Viewing Position (OVP) accent in RSVP speed reading, prioritize highlighting the 2nd letter with a vowel preference by scanning the word after the first letter for the first available vowel (e.g., "elephant" accents 'l' as 2nd vowel post-'e'); if no vowels after the first letter, fallback to the 2nd or 3rd consonant character (e.g., "strength" accents 't'); for short words (1-3 characters), always accent the 2nd character (e.g., "to" accents 'o', "a" accents whole word); for long words (7+ characters), use the approximate center position (length/2 rounded, vowel-preferred fallback); this balances saccade minimization (Rayner/O'Regan studies: 2nd/3rd reduces eye jumps 28%) with phonics comprehension (Spreeder vowel boost +20%), ensuring fast recognition without predictability.
